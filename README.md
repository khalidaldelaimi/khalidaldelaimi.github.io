### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Part 2 of lab 4 was one of my favorites because it was one of the first
    true games we had created. It interacted with the user playing the game
    which I really enjoyed and it created a spark in what I could possibly
    create in the future. I find it intruging that the world of computer
    science is limitless in what someone could create and this lab had shown
    me some possible outcomes.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was another one of my favorites because I really enjoy
    playing backjack. I found it fun to create a game I have known and
    played for years. The cool part about this lab was intergrating the
    ace as a special card. It was one of the first labs we had done where
    we needed to create multiple different functions which helped me learn
    that writing code is complicated but fun.


* Lab 9

    In lab 9 part 1 we had created a judges scorecard. This is one of my favorites
    because I have used it for watching a boxing match! Not only did I have
    fun creating a judges scorecard I also enjoyed using it in a real match.
    Seeing the possibilties and tools I am able to create just using a
    laptop motivates me to become a better coder to create more cool and
    unique labs just like this one.
